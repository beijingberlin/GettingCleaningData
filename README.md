# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

When run inside the base directory of the UCI Human Activity
Recognition dataset, the script "run\_analysis.R" creates the *tidy*
dataset "human\_activity.txt".

The tidy dataset merges the training set and the test set of the
original dataset. Its variables are means computed for each given
subject and activity, of a subset of the training features. For a
description of the variables, consult Codebook.md.

For license and citation information of the dataset, see README.txt
in the original data file, which can be obtained at
